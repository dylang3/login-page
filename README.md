# login-page

This page was built following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g7rFjOuggU) on YouTube. I've added a few additional elements myself (which are noted in the code).

# To-do:
* Add credit to [the YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g7rFjOuggU) on the page, probably in the footer
* Fix positioning of the form when the screen size is large (it seems too far left currently)
* Add some Javascript!
